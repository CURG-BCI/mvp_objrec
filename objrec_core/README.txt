1. Introduction.

Thank you for taking interest in our work and downloading this
software. This software implements a modified version of the
algorithm described in the papers

 * Chavdar Papazov and Darius Burschka: "An Efficient RANSAC for 3D
   Object Recognition in Noisy and Occluded Scenes". In Proceedings
   of the 10th Asian Conference on Computer Vision (ACCV'10), 2010

 * Chavdar Papazov, Sami Haddadin, Sven Parusel, Kai Krieger, and
   Darius Burschka: "Rigid 3D Geometry Matching for Grasping of
   Known Objects in Cluttered Scenes". International Journal of
   Robotics Research, 31, April 2012.

If you use this software please cite the aforementioned papers in
any resulting publication.

Please send questions, comments and/or bug reports to
Chavdar Papazov (papazov@in.tum.de)

The software was tested on 64bit Linux (Fedora 12 and Ubuntu 11.10).
